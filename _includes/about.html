                    Join us on November 22nd in Rotkreuz for hack.commit.push Switzerland 2025! A full-day, community-driven Hackergarten where developers come together to collaborate, learn, and contribute to Free and Open Source Software.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left">
                    Weâ€™ll kick off the day with project pitches by maintainers from various technologies and programming languages. Whether youâ€™re an experienced contributor or completely new to open source, youâ€™ll find welcoming mentors and plenty of opportunities to get started.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left">
                    The entire day is dedicated to hands-on hacking: fixing issues, adding features, improving documentation, or even working on design. You can freely move between projects and explore different topics.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left">
                    At the end of the day, weâ€™ll showcase our achievements, celebrate what we built together, and close with a relaxing apÃ©ro.
                </p>

                <p class="text-left">
                    This is a non-commercial, community-driven event, organized to strengthen open source collaboration. The fee of CHF 20 helps avoid no-shows and covers drinks, snacks, and lunch for the whole day.
